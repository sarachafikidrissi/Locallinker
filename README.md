# My Portfolio Project 

## Locallinker

## Introduction

Our project is all about bringing people together in their local community. We're creating a Local Service Marketplace that helps connect folks who need services with those who provide them. Whether you're looking for a plumber, a tutor, or a dog walker, our platform makes it easy to find trusted providers right in your neighborhood. We understand the struggle of trying to find reliable services nearby, so we're here to make that process simple and stress-free for everyone involved.
